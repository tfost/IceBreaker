#IceBreaker!
#####Introduction
Icebreaker is a Dungeon-crawling puzzle game inspired by button pushing and spatial movement puzzles seen in games such as
Undertale or Pokemon. The player is a treasure hunter who is tasked with exploring multiple temples in
order to advance to the end and get the treasure. Each successive room gets harder, building on new mechanics
introduced in each room.

#####Features to be added
1. Directed sliding - Frictionless Tiles have a direction. When we land on them, we move in the direction they point, instead of
moving around randomly
2. Push Puzzles - If we walk into a rock or  a box, we can push it around to activate wheighted buttons.
3. Using items - we can carry around different types of items to have different effects.
